<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Statistical Learning, Small Data and Big Data</h1>

</div>


<p><strong>What is Big Data? Does “Small Data” even exist?</strong></p>
<p>Big Data is shaking the business world but… what is Big Data? Is it an evolution of something that already existed and was called “Data” or “Small Data”? Is it Statistic? Is it about exploiting the information stored on Internet?</p>
<p>I can’t boast that I know the answers but I’m searching for them and I want to share here what I’ve already understood, because sharing is fun and because I believe that nobody has understood something if he or she can’t explain it in simple terms. So, I’m putting my knowledge to the test here.</p>
<p><strong>At the beginning we had: Statistical Learning</strong></p>
<p>Statistical Learning was already between us long time before we had to classify data in “Big” and “Not so big”. Experts in Statistical Learning were known as data scientists and by the end of the 1970s they had developed techniques like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exploratory Data Analysis</li>
<li>Statistical Inference</li>
<li>Linear regression</li>
<li>Logistic regression</li>
<li>Generalized linear models</li>
</ul>
<p>The ultimate goal of these techniques was (and still is) to <em>learn from data</em>: using data extracted from a population to make models and using these models to predict a future behaviour of the population or, at least, to achieve a better understanding of the main components of the population.</p>
<p>Non-linear techniques where computationally prohibitive but this situation changed in the 1980s and new methods were introduced taking advantage of the unprecedented computer power:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classification and regression trees</li>
<li>Cross Validation</li>
<li>Generalizes additive models</li>
</ul>
<p>Then came the revolution: Internet, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Google, YouTube, Instagram and smartphones equipped with high definition cameras and accelerometers. Nowadays, these social networks and gadgets store globally more data every two days than were collected in the entire 20th century by any means. A bit scary.</p>
<p>On one hand, it was overwhelming for data scientists coping with this but on the other hand the revolution itself provided help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal computers’ processing power has moved forward at an incredible pace while prices have felt down, so data scientists have no longer to apply for using a big computer in some big lab for a couple of hours.</li>
<li>Powerful software has been developed and, in some cases such as the R system, they are even freely available (so any data scientist can use them and contribute to enhance them)</li>
<li>New types of data store systems, such that Hadoop HDFS, have been designed to stores huge data files across multiple machines and manage them fast and efficiently.</li>
<li>New engines, such that Apache Spark, have been built to manage huge data files either on the old or new store systems</li>
<li>Companies like Amazon, Google or Microsoft offer to “rent” their computers for an affordable hourly rate to store and process data</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Now we have… Machine Learning</strong></p>
<p>So Internet social networks combined with digital gadgets posed new defies, in the form of gigantic data sets, to Statistical Learning and, at the same time, provided tools to handle them.</p>
<p>It was (or it is) the beginning of a new era for Statistical Learning, now so connected to machines to get and manage data that the entire field is better known as Machine Learning.</p>
<p><strong>And why is all that so important in real life?</strong></p>
<p>The key is <em>prediction</em>. The list of organizations interested in prediction is never ending:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any sales department would want to be able to predict the effect on sales of advertising expenditure in different media (tv, radio, newspapers, Facebook…)</li>
<li>Any government would want to be able to predict the impact on unemployment of new economic measures</li>
<li>Any political party would want to be able to predict the impact on votes of some policys they are thinking to support</li>
<li>Any pharmaceutical company would want to be able to predict the side effects of a new medicament they are developing</li>
<li>Any person with shares in a company would want to be able to predict the effect on the stocks of a new strategy of the company</li>
<li>Any insurance company would want to be able to predict the likelihood of his customers having expensive medical problems</li>
</ul>
<p>And so forth…</p>
<p>Data scientists have been trying to make these predictions but there was always a problem to take accuracy to the highest level: not enough data. Not enough data to construct a prediction model, not enough data to test the model…</p>
<p>Well, according to what we have said above, there are no more excuses: we have tons of data and tools to analyse them. So, everybody is expecting high level predictions on any issue.</p>
<p>Will it happen? Nobody knows or, at least, I don’t know. But it’s worth a try to learn about all of this.</p>
<p><strong>What can we fin in this web site?</strong></p>
<p>I’ll be offering in the blog briefings of what I know so far (not much) and what I manage to learn (as much as possible) about the issues outlined above.</p>
<p>That’s all. Hope you all like it!</p>
